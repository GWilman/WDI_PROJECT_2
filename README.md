# GA WDI30 Project 2 - TRAX

Share music with your friends, chat and comment on each others posts, and build a custom playlist of all of your favourite tunes.

TRAX is a full-stack, RESTful Express app built using Node.js, Mongo Database, JavaScript, SaSS and Bootstrap (CSS framework). It has been designed with mobile in mind as is fully responsive.

###### Users create an account on TRAX, a painless process that allows them to view the wall, add new tracks and create their own playlist.

###### Once logged in, the wall is the main focus of the app. It presents a timeline of all songs posted by all users. New tracks are added at the top via a simple box and, once posted, appear at the head of the timeline as the most recent track.

###### The input box can handle any type of YouTube link, snipping the video's ID from the URL before embedding the song on the wall, accompanied with a message.

###### Users can chat in the dropdown comment section below and add songs to their personal playlist via the add to playlist link. If already added, this link becomes a remove link.

###### The playlist page lists the user's favourite songs in a stripped back format with simple 'view details' or 'remove' options.

###### The app therefore fulfilled my mission, which was to build an app allowing users to:

###### - Create / edit profile.
###### - Log in / out.
###### - Create / edit / delete posts.
###### - Add / delete comments.
###### - Add / remove posts from personal user playlist.

I was very pleased with the way TRAX worked out and it is something that I would love to develop further in the future. My ideas for further expansion include:

- The ability to handle non-YouTube links. (SoundCloud, Spotify etc.)
- The implementation of AJAX (not yet learned at time of build) to negate the need for regular page loads.
- Allow users to be members of multiple groups and the ability to easily switch between the walls of each group. The personal playlist could be made up of songs from any group.
- Allow continuous, sequential play of songs from wall or playlist.
